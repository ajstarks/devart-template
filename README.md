# Programming Pictures with Go

This entry uses three separate projects that allow artists and programmers to use code to "make pictures".
The projects all use the Go programming language for coding.  The projects are:

* [SVGo: a Go library for SVG generation](http://github.com/ajstarks/svgo)
* [OpenVG: a high-level API to the OpenVG standard, developed on the Raspberry Pi](http://github.com/ajstarks/openvg)
* [Deck: a Go package for making and serving scalable presentions using a standard markup language](github.com/ajstarks/deck)
